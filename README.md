Vulscano is a TATA Communications developed application that handles Vulnerability Scanning and Reporting for Cisco IOS/IOS-XE devices.

It is currently **tightly coupled** with Anuta NCX as the inventory source to automate devices scans, although it is possible to launch ad-hoc scans on devices not part of the inventory.



## Software Version Requirement

Container is the core of Vulscano infrastructure and therefore following software is required:

| Software       | Version        | 
| -------------- |:--------------:| 
| Docker CE      | `>=17.04.0-ce` | 
| Docker-Compose |    `1.22.0`    |


> **Note:** Linux distro is highly recommended to run Docker


## Getting Started

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lucabrasi83/vulscano.git
