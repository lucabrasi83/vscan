Vulscano is a TATA Communications developed application that handles Vulnerability Scanning and Reporting for Cisco IOS/IOS-XE devices.

It is currently **tightly coupled** with Anuta NCX as the inventory source to automate devices scans, although it is possible to launch ad-hoc scans on devices not part of the inventory.
